# Project : Follow Me

## Data collection

* Data gathered by following the hero in a very dense crowd.
* Data gathered while in patrol directly over the hero, while they zigzag.
* Data gathered while the quad is on standard patrol.

In order to maximize data that includes target while the UAV is not in follow mode, multiple data collection runs were done by moving the UAV manually to track the target, as well as to monitor distance from the target.

## Network Architecture

filter depth of the layers in the FCN was experimented with to optimize the network architecture.
